# DS4Help
Simple script that helps running DS4Windows' exclusive mode. (https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows)

It stops all processes that are known to block DS4Windows from using exclusive mode. (Game Launcher, Xbox gamebar, etc.)

At the moment its "optimised" for NVIDIA systems. (it'll try to end all the nvidia services, doesn't make sense on a system with a AMD GPU...) More compatibility and features will be added soon. 

# Tutorilla:
Simply download the script and open it with admin rights.
After opening press a button to start the script, it'll end the processes.
